Android build rules
===================

This directory contains a set of build rules for Android applications.
They've got reasonable feature coverage now but are still fairly
unpolished and can be tripped up by various features of the Android
build process, which is fairly complex.


Native rules
------------

There are also a set of rules for development using the NDK.
These are still pretty experimental, even more so than most other
things in this repository.
